Once I went to Paris in the middle of the night.  I had no plans to do so.  I bought a ticket, packed a bag and left. On the way there I got my hotels booked.  While enjoying the velvet walls, the light, wine for lunch and the unexpectedly friendliness of the people of the city, I decided to head for the coast.  One of my guests, from days past, invited me to stay at their empty house on the sea.  It was set to be empty for a month.  I stayed in Provence for a month after a week in Paris and it was my own best idea of paradise. I've been back to France since.  I love it there.  That first trip though, was on a birthday a few years ago.  Nothing has come close to those days of my life in a very long time.
